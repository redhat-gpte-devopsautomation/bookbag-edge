== Overview

You can access environment variables as flattened `{}`-surrounded variables in these templated AsciiDoc files.

=== Variables from ENV as AsciiDoc attributes

NOTE: JSON objects are flattened and joined with a `.`.
As a side-effect of the `.`, any character will match the `.` in the variable name.

.Example: All of these function
----
:guid: {guid}
:openshift_cluster_console_url: {openshift_cluster_console_url}
:openshift_cluster_admin_username: {openshift_cluster_admin_username}
:openshift_cluster_admin_password: {openshift_cluster_admin_password}
:ssh_command: "ssh lab-user@{bastion_public_hostname}
:ssh_password: {bastion_ssh_password}
:user: {openshift_cluster_user_base}
:user_info_messages: {user_info_messages}

== Intro

In this workshop, you will learn and explor Red Hat OpenShift Data Science using a real life AI/ML based edge use case.
The following content is an example of what to include in an overview.

=== Lab Access

You can access your lab environment as lab-user with password %ssh_password% with the following command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
%ssh_command%
----

Your lab GUID is "%guid%".

=== Workshop Information

Informational messages generated for your workshop:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
